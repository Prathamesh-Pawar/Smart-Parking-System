# Smart-Parking-System
This project is to design a smart parking system which can automatically allocate a parking space for a car through internet.
This system can help a driver to reserve a parking space for his car which he can use for a specific amount of time.
This system can help avoid the congestion in traffic due to illegally parked vehicles.

For this system we have used an Arduino ESP8266 for the precossing of the data
We used Firebase as a server to store and relay the data to other platforms
The original model was made using IR sensors and Arduino.
